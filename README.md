# BGR_sky130
This github repository is for the design of a Band Gap Reference Circuit (BGR) using Google-skywater130 PDK.

## Introduction to BGR
The Bandgap Reference (BGR) is a circuit which provides a stable voltage output which is independent of factors like temperature, supply voltage.

### Why BGR 
- A battery is unsuitable for use as a reference voltage source.
  - voltage drops over time
- A typical power supply is also not suitable 
  - noisy output and/or residual ripple.
- A voltage reference IC used buried Zener diode, 
  - Discrete design required additional components and high frequency filtering circuits due to higher thermal noise.
  - Low voltage Zener  diode is not available

**Solution**
- A Bangap reference which can be integrated in bulk CMOS, Bi-CMOS or Bipolar technologies without the use of  external components.

### Features of BGR
- Temp. independent voltage reference circuit widely used in Integrated Circuits
- Produces constant voltage regardless of power supply variation, temp. Changes and circuit loading
- Output voltage of 1.2v (close to the band gap energy of silicon at 0 deg kelvin)
- All applications starting from analog, digital, mixed mode, RF and system-on-chip (SoC).

### Applications of BGR
- Low dropout regulators (LDO)
- DC-to-DC buck converters
- Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC)
- Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)

## 1. Tools and PDK setup

### 1.1 Tools Setup
For the design and simulation of the BGR circuit we will need the following tools.
- Spice netlist simulation - [Ngspice]
- Layout Design and DRC - [Magic]
- LVS - [Netgen]

### 1.1.1 Ngspice

[Ngspice](http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/devel.html) is the open source spice simulator for electric and electronic circuits. Ngspice is an open project, there is no closed group of developers.

**Steps to install Ngspice** - 
Open the terminal and type the following to install Ngspice
```
$  sudo apt-get install ngspice
```
### 1.1.2 Magic

 [Magic](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/) is a VLSI layout tool.
 
**Steps to install Magic** - 
 Open the terminal and type the following to install Magic
```
$  wget http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/archive/magic-8.3.32.tgz
$  tar xvfz magic-8.3.32.tgz
$  cd magic-8.3.28
$  ./configure
$  sudo make
$  sudo make install
```
### 1.1.3 Netgen

[Netgen] is a tool for comparing netlists, a process known as LVS, which stands for "Layout vs. Schematic". This is an important step in the integrated circuit design flow, ensuring that the geometry that has been laid out matches the expected circuit.

**Steps to install Netgen** - Open the terminal and type the following to insatll Netgen.
```
$  git clone git://opencircuitdesign.com/netgen
$  cd netgen
$  ./configure
$  sudo make
$  sudo make install 
```
### 1.2 PDK Setup

A process design kit (PDK) is a set of files used within the semiconductor industry to model a fabrication process for the design tools used to design an integrated circuit. The PDK is created by the foundry defining a certain technology variation for their processes. It is then passed to their customers to use in the design process.

The PDK we are going to use for this BGR is Google Skywater-130 (130 nm) PDK.

**Steps to download PDK** - Open the terminal and type the following to download sky130 PDK.
```
$  git clone https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks.git
$  cd open_pdks
$  ./configure [options]
$  make
$  [sudo] make install
```
